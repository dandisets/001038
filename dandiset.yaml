description: Dopamine neurons are characterized by their response to unexpected rewards,
  but they also fire during movement and aversive stimuli. Dopamine neuron diversity
  has been observed based on molecular expression profiles; however, whether different
  functions map onto such genetic subtypes remains unclear. In this study, we established
  that three genetic dopamine neuron subtypes within the substantia nigra pars compacta,
  characterized by the expression of Slc17a6 (Vglut2), Calb1 and Anxa1, each have
  a unique set of responses to rewards, aversive stimuli and accelerations and decelerations,
  and these signaling patterns are highly correlated between somas and axons within
  subtypes. Remarkably, reward responses were almost entirely absent in the Anxa1+
  subtype, which instead displayed acceleration-correlated signaling. Our findings
  establish a connection between functional and genetic dopamine neuron subtypes and
  demonstrate that molecular expression patterns can serve as a common framework to
  dissect dopaminergic functions.
